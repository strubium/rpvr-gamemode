# rpvr-gamemode
A gamemode for garry's mod I am making to learn gLua and all its magical BS.  

## Features
* A system for spawning npc's at random points (Spawns every 5 seconds, planned to only spawn durning "night")
* A day and night system (Not implemented, going to use Atoms) 
* Zombie NPC's, see below


## The Zombies
I may have gotten over my head by imagining a super smart nextbot but he it goes:
* Zombies spawn during the night
* During the day, they retreat to a "hiding spot" not by the player and only if they are really close
* When it is night, any player made noises can lure zombies to the players location, where they will attack.
