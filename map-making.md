# Map Making
This is a guide for making maps for this gamemode, but please dont bother your time by making any.

## Phys Props 
Yes! Please incude these. This gamemode does not add a spawn menu so any useful props must be added into the map. 
Make sure the props do not fade away when broken.

## Pickups
Weapons or ammo, these are needed for the zombies to actually be killed.

## Npc Nodes
The gamemode spawns stock npc_fastzombie's so they will need Nodes to move around. 
If your feeling fancy, add some [Climb Nodes](https://developer.valvesoftware.com/wiki/Info_node_climb) where needed.
